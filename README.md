## About

[Splatter Paint](https://splatterpaint.vercel.app/) is a simple splatter painting website built using the HTML ```<canvas>``` element and the Paper.js library that allows you to make the following colorful shapes in the browser: 

- Random circles of different colors and sizes when moving the mouse.
- Brushstrokes of different colors and thicknesses when dragging the mouse.

After drawing something, you also have the option to export your canvas as an svg image if you want!

## Motivations

I made this project as part of the Hack Club [Splatter Paint](https://workshops.hackclub.com/splatter_paint/) workshop to improve my coding skills, which I later enhanced with new features of my own.
