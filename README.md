## 📜 About

[Splatter Paint](https://splatterpaint.vercel.app/) is a simple splatter painting website built with an HTML canvas and Paper.js which allows to make colorful shapes in the browser: 

- Random circles of different colors and size when moving the mouse.
- Brush strokes of different colors and thickness when dragging it.

To do:
- [x] Export the canvas as a ```svg``` file.
