# About üóÉÔ∏è

[Splatter Paint](https://splatterpaint.vercel.app/) is a website featuring a simple yet awesome coding solution to draw on a HTML Canvas, and it's built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the ```  Paper.js ```  Library.
It was made possible with the help of Hack Club's ``` Splatter-Paint ``` [Workshop](https://workshops.hackclub.com/splatter_paint/), customized in depth with different options like:

- Moving around the mouse to draw circles of different sizes and colors.
- Dragging the mouse to make a linear path.

- Things to do: 
- [ ] The ability of export the canvas as a ``` SVG ``` Image.

An example of how the code works under the hood is the following snippet, which function is to make the colorful and random circles that are available on the canvas:

``` JavaScript
tool.fixedDistance = 30
var layer = project.activeLayer

function onMouseMove(event) {
  var path = new Path.Circle({
    center: event.middlePoint,
    radius: Math.round(Math.random() * 30) + 5
  })
  path.fillColor = {
    hue: event.count * 3,
    saturation: 1,
    brightness: 1
  }
}
```

# How to use it üíª

Splatter Paint is very easy to use, just open the canvas and start drawing!
